# Major Switching Patterns and Outcomes

## Key Papers

### Major Decision: The Impact of Major Switching on Academic Outcomes in Community Colleges
**Authors**: Vivian Yuen Ting Liu, Soumya Mishra, Elizabeth M. Kopko (2020)  
**Source**: Research in Higher Education  
**URL**: https://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/major-switching-academic-outcomes-community-colleges.html

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: What are the effects of major switching on student outcomes, particularly completion rates and time to degree?

**Prior Assumptions**: Literature assumes major switching delays or impedes completion through excess credit accumulation and represents suboptimal initial decisions (Stability as Success Assumption).

**Insight**: Major switching increases certificate completion rates and can represent better academic matching rather than poor planning. The effects are more nuanced than traditionally assumed.

**Technical Approach**: Used state administrative data with propensity score matching to control for selection effects. Compared switchers to non-switchers across multiple outcomes.

**Evaluation**: Found major switching increased certificate completion rates but moderately decreased bachelor's degree completion probability for community college students.

**Impact**: Challenges Stability as Success Assumption - switching can represent strategic exploration and better matching rather than failure. Supports Non-Linear Exploration Value hypothesis.

### How Changing Majors Impacts Academic Performance among Undergraduate Students
**Authors**: Min Xu, Chandra R. de Silva (2024)  
**Source**: International Journal of Research and Innovation in Social Science  
**URL**: https://rsisinternational.org/journals/ijriss/articles/how-changing-majors-impacts-academic-performance-among-undergraduate-students/

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: When do students change majors, how frequently, and what is the relationship between major changing and academic performance?

**Prior Assumptions**: Traditional view assumes major changing indicates poor initial decision-making and negatively impacts academic performance and timely graduation.

**Insight**: About half of undergraduate students change majors at least once, and this is a normal part of the major selection process rather than an aberration.

**Technical Approach**: Retrospective tracking of five graduating classes at a regional research university, analyzing timing of major declarations and changes.

**Evaluation**: Provided empirical evidence on when students declare majors, reach final decisions, and identified optimal timing for major changes to maintain timely graduation.

**Impact**: Supports Non-Linear Exploration Value hypothesis - major switching is a normative exploration process rather than a deviation from optimal decision-making.

### From Matriculation to Completion: How College Students Move Between Majors
**Authors**: American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2025)  
**Source**: Humanities Indicators Research Brief  
**URL**: https://www.amacad.org/publication/matriculation-completion-how-college-students-move-between-majors

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: How do students move between different academic fields (particularly humanities) from matriculation to graduation?

**Prior Assumptions**: Linear Decision Process Assumption - students follow predictable exploration → decision → commitment stages.

**Insight**: Student movement between majors is complex and non-linear, with significant patterns of entry and exit from different academic fields throughout college career.

**Technical Approach**: Large-scale analysis of student major transitions using national data on college students from matriculation to completion.

**Evaluation**: Tracked major changes across entire college career, analyzing patterns of field switching and completion rates by major transition patterns.

**Impact**: Demonstrates complex, non-linear major choice processes that challenge Linear Decision Process Assumption. Shows major "exploration" continues throughout college, not just in early years.
