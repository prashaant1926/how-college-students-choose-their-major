# Research Concept & Direction

## Core Research Problem

While we know college majors significantly impact post-college outcomes and exhibit patterns by race, gender, and class, the fundamental assumptions underlying how students choose their majors remain largely unchallenged. The literature has made implicit assumptions about student decision-making that may not reflect the complex, non-linear reality of major choice processes.

## Literature-Level Assumptions to Challenge

Across the college major choice literature, several pervasive assumptions emerge that warrant systematic inversion:

### 1. **Rationality Assumption**

**Literature assumes**: Students make major choices through systematic cost-benefit analysis, weighing career prospects, salary potential, and personal interests in deliberate fashion.

### 2. **Individual Agency Assumption**

**Literature assumes**: Students are primarily autonomous decision-makers who exercise independent choice in selecting majors.

### 3. **Linear Decision Process Assumption**

**Literature assumes**: Major choice follows predictable stages (exploration → decision → commitment) with switching indicating suboptimal initial decisions.

### 4. **Information Sufficiency Assumption**

**Literature assumes**: Providing more or better information about majors and career outcomes improves decision quality.

### 5. **Stability as Success Assumption**

**Literature assumes**: Staying in one's initial major represents successful decision-making, while switching indicates poor planning or indecision.

### 6. **Future Orientation Assumption**

**Literature assumes**: Students primarily choose majors based on projected future outcomes rather than present experiences.

## Novel Hypotheses: Flipping Core Assumptions

### Hypothesis 1: **Intuitive Decision Primacy**

**Assumption flip**: Rather than rational analysis, students make major choices primarily through intuitive, experiential processes.
**Novel angle**: Immediate classroom experiences, faculty interactions, and peer culture have stronger predictive power than economic projections or career planning activities.
**Impact**: Would reshape academic advising from information provision to experience facilitation.

### Hypothesis 2: **Collective Agency Dynamics**

**Assumption flip**: Major choice is fundamentally a collective, socially-negotiated process rather than individual decision-making.
**Novel angle**: Students' major choices emerge from complex social networks, identity negotiations, and cultural positioning rather than personal preference optimization.
**Impact**: Would shift research focus from individual psychology to social network analysis and cultural capital studies.

### Hypothesis 3: **Non-Linear Exploration Value**

**Assumption flip**: Major switching represents sophisticated exploration strategy, not decision failure.
**Novel angle**: Students who switch majors develop superior meta-cognitive skills and interdisciplinary thinking that benefits long-term outcomes.
**Impact**: Would reframe academic policies to encourage rather than discourage major exploration.

### Hypothesis 4: **Information Saturation Paradox**

**Assumption flip**: Excess information degrades rather than improves decision quality in major choice.
**Novel angle**: Students make better major choices when guided by minimal, experiential information rather than comprehensive data about programs and careers.
**Impact**: Would fundamentally alter college information systems and advising approaches.

### Hypothesis 5: **Present-Moment Decision Making**

**Assumption flip**: Students choose majors based primarily on immediate fit and present experiences rather than future projections.
**Novel angle**: Current classroom engagement, faculty mentorship quality, and peer community integration predict satisfaction better than career outcome data.
**Impact**: Would shift institutional focus from career services to present-moment educational quality.

## Research Direction & Methodology

This research will test these hypothesis flips using:

1. **Longitudinal tracking** of decision processes (not just outcomes)
2. **Experience sampling** to capture real-time decision factors
3. **Social network analysis** of peer and family influences
4. **Qualitative analysis** of decision narratives to identify non-rational patterns
5. **Experimental manipulation** of information provision vs. experiential exposure

## Potential Impact

By systematically inverting literature-level assumptions, this research could:

* **Reshape academic advising** from information-based to experience-based approaches
* **Reframe institutional policies** around major switching and exploration
* **Influence admissions practices** to focus on community building rather than career preparation
* **Guide curriculum design** to optimize for present engagement rather than future utility
* **Transform higher education metrics** from completion-focused to exploration-focused

## Key Research Questions

1. How do immediate experiential factors compare to future-oriented factors in predicting major choice satisfaction?
2. What role do social networks play in major choice compared to individual preferences?
3. How does major switching behavior correlate with meta-cognitive development and interdisciplinary thinking?
4. What is the optimal amount and type of information for major choice decision-making?
5. How do present-moment classroom experiences predict long-term major commitment better than career projections?
