# Experiment Ideas

## Overview

This research program systematically tests five literature-level assumption flips about college major choice through rigorous experimental designs. Each experiment employs Computer Science-inspired methodology with clear hypotheses, controlled variables, and robust validity measures. The experimental approach combines longitudinal tracking, experience sampling, social network analysis, and controlled interventions to challenge fundamental assumptions in the major choice literature.

**Core Experimental Strategy**: Rather than observational studies that reinforce existing assumptions, these experiments directly manipulate key variables to test whether assumption inversions hold. Each experiment is designed to be executed by AI agents with clear protocols, measurable outcomes, and replicable procedures.

## Planned Experiments

### Experiment 1: Intuitive vs. Rational Decision-Making Study
**Testing Hypothesis 1: Intuitive Decision Primacy**

  - **External Influences**: Monitor and control for outside information sources

- **Success Metrics**:
  - **Primary**: Inverse relationship between information load and decision satisfaction (Î² < -0.3)
  - **Secondary**: Lower cognitive load and higher confidence in minimal information condition
  - **Process**: Evidence of satisficing behavior in high-information conditions

### Experiment 5: Present-Moment vs. Future-Oriented Decision Making
