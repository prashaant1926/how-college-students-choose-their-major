{"id":"h001","assumption":"Rationality Assumption - Students make major choices through systematic cost-benefit analysis, weighing career prospects, salary potential, and personal interests in deliberate fashion","hypothesis":"Intuitive Decision Primacy - Students make major choices primarily through intuitive, experiential processes. Immediate classroom experiences, faculty interactions, and peer culture have stronger predictive power than economic projections or career planning activities","impact":"Would reshape academic advising from information provision to experience facilitation","timestamp":"2025-08-14T00:47:30.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h002","assumption":"Individual Agency Assumption - Students are primarily autonomous decision-makers who exercise independent choice in selecting majors","hypothesis":"Collective Agency Dynamics - Major choice is fundamentally a collective, socially-negotiated process. Students' major choices emerge from complex social networks, identity negotiations, and cultural positioning rather than personal preference optimization","impact":"Would shift research focus from individual psychology to social network analysis and cultural capital studies","timestamp":"2025-08-14T00:47:30.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h003","assumption":"Linear Decision Process Assumption - Major choice follows predictable stages (exploration → decision → commitment) with switching indicating suboptimal initial decisions","hypothesis":"Non-Linear Exploration Value - Major switching represents sophisticated exploration strategy, not decision failure. Students who switch majors develop superior meta-cognitive skills and interdisciplinary thinking that benefits long-term outcomes","impact":"Would reframe academic policies to encourage rather than discourage major exploration","timestamp":"2025-08-14T00:47:30.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h004","assumption":"Information Sufficiency Assumption - Providing more or better information about majors and career outcomes improves decision quality","hypothesis":"Information Saturation Paradox - Excess information degrades rather than improves decision quality in major choice. Students make better major choices when guided by minimal, experiential information rather than comprehensive data about programs and careers","impact":"Would fundamentally alter college information systems and advising approaches","timestamp":"2025-08-14T00:47:30.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h005","assumption":"Stability as Success Assumption - Staying in one's initial major represents successful decision-making, while switching indicates poor planning or indecision","hypothesis":"Exploration as Strategic Success - Major switching represents sophisticated exploration strategy that develops transferable skills and deeper self-knowledge","impact":"Would reshape institutional metrics and policies around major retention vs. exploration","timestamp":"2025-08-14T00:47:30.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h006","assumption":"Future Orientation Assumption - Students primarily choose majors based on projected future outcomes rather than present experiences","hypothesis":"Present-Moment Decision Making - Students choose majors based primarily on immediate fit and present experiences. Current classroom engagement, faculty mentorship quality, and peer community integration predict satisfaction better than career outcome data","impact":"Would shift institutional focus from career services to present-moment educational quality","timestamp":"2025-08-14T00:47:30.000Z","status":"proposed"}
