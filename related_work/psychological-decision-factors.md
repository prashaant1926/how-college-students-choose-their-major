## Overview
This document analyzes research on psychological processes, cognitive factors, and decision-making mechanisms underlying college major choice decisions.

## Key Papers

### Major Choices: Students' Personal Intelligence, Considerations When Choosing a Major, and Academic Success
**Authors**: Kateryna Sylaska, John D. Mayer (2024)  
**Source**: Journal of Intelligence  
**URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11595732/

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: How does personal intelligence (self-understanding ability) influence major choice quality and academic success?

**Prior Assumptions**: Traditional literature assumes all students have similar capacity for self-reflection and decision-making about major choices.

**Insight**: Personal intelligence significantly influences major choice quality - students with higher personal intelligence make more satisfying and successful major choices.

**Technical Approach**: Psychometric assessment of personal intelligence combined with major choice satisfaction surveys and academic outcome tracking.

**Evaluation**: Found significant correlations between personal intelligence scores, major choice satisfaction, and subsequent academic success measures.

**Impact**: Challenges Individual Agency Assumption by showing systematic individual differences in decision-making capacity. Supports need for differentiated advising approaches.

### Why Students Select their College Major: An Investigative Study
**Authors**: Kate N. Matthews, Diane R. Edmondson, Lucy Matthews (2024)  
**Source**: Academic Management Journal  
**URL**: https://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/amj/vol13/iss1/11/

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: What factors most influence students' college major selection, and how do these compare to traditional assumptions about rational decision-making?

**Prior Assumptions**: Students systematically weigh external factors like career prospects, salary potential, and market demand in major selection (Rationality Assumption).

**Insight**: Interest and passion rank as highest influence factors, followed by personality fit. External influences (career prospects, salary) were less relevant than expected.

**Technical Approach**: Survey study with 1,177 undergraduates at southeastern U.S. university, using factor analysis and demographic comparisons.

**Evaluation**: Found intrinsic factors (interest/passion, personality fit) significantly outranked external factors (salary, career prospects) in major choice decisions.

**Impact**: Strongly challenges Rationality Assumption - students use intuitive, intrinsic factors rather than systematic economic analysis. Supports Intuitive Decision Primacy hypothesis.

### The Relationship Between College Students' Indecisiveness and Career Decision-Making: The Mediating Role of Anxiety
**Authors**: Yangang Yang, Rowena Libo-on, Margen Java, Li Feng (2024)  
**Source**: Journal of Individual Psychology and Development  
**URL**: https://systems.enpress-publisher.com/index.php/jipd/article/view/9293

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: How do indecisiveness and anxiety interact to affect students' career decision-making ability, particularly regarding major choice?

**Prior Assumptions**: Individual Agency Assumption - students make major choices through rational individual processes unaffected by emotional states.

**Insight**: Anxiety partially mediates the relationship between indecisiveness and career decision-making ability, with complex interactions based on major satisfaction.

**Technical Approach**: Survey of 1,072 Chinese college students using Indecisiveness Scale, Career Exploration and Decision Self-Efficacy Scale, and Generalized Anxiety Scale-7.

**Evaluation**: Found anxiety significantly mediates indecisiveness-decision making relationship, with major satisfaction moderating these effects.

**Impact**: Challenges Rationality and Individual Agency Assumptions by demonstrating emotional and psychological factors significantly influence major-related decision processes.

### Reflection on Purpose Changes Students' Academic Interests: A Scalable Intervention in an Online Course Catalog
**Authors**: Youjie Chen, Pranathi Iyer, Rene F. Kizilcec (2024)  
**Source**: arXiv  
**URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19035

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: Can interventions encouraging reflection on purpose during course exploration change students' academic interests and choices?

**Prior Assumptions**: Academic interests are stable individual characteristics unaffected by brief interventions (Individual Agency + Future Orientation Assumptions).

**Insight**: Purpose reflection intervention significantly changed students' course interests, increasing interest in creative arts and social change while decreasing interest in computer/data science.

**Technical Approach**: Randomized field experiment with over 4,000 students at large U.S. university, embedded intervention in online course catalog.

**Evaluation**: Measured changes in course exploration behavior and interest patterns before/after purpose reflection intervention.

**Impact**: Challenges both Individual Agency and Future Orientation Assumptions - shows academic interests are malleable and responsive to present-moment reflection rather than fixed individual characteristics.

### Will I Be Happy in This Major? Predicting Intrinsic Motivation and Subjective Well-Being
**Authors**: Multiple authors (2023)  
**Source**: Social Psychology of Education  
**URL**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11218-023-09835-6

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: Can prospective students' well-being forecasts and interest-major fit forecasts predict their later motivation and satisfaction in their chosen major?

**Prior Assumptions**: Students cannot accurately predict their future satisfaction in academic programs (challenging Future Orientation Assumption).

**Insight**: Students' well-being forecasts and subjective interest-major fit forecasts significantly predict later motivation and satisfaction, though objective fit measures add predictive value.

**Technical Approach**: Longitudinal field study tracking over 4,000 prospective students, with 234 entering psychology major and completing follow-up surveys about motivation and well-being.

**Evaluation**: Found well-being forecasts predicted higher motivation, positive affect, and satisfaction; interest-major fit forecasts provided additional predictive power.

**Impact**: Partially supports Future Orientation Assumption while showing students have some predictive ability about their satisfaction, though this can be improved with objective assessments.

### Academic Major Satisfaction Scale: Psychometric Properties and Proposal for a Measure of Academic Dropout Intention
**Authors**: Susana K. Lingán-Huamán, Sergio Dominguez-Lara, et al. (2025)  
**Source**: Frontiers in Education  
**URL**: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2025.1519475/full

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: How can academic major satisfaction be reliably measured, and how does it relate to dropout intentions and academic outcomes?

**Prior Assumptions**: Major satisfaction is primarily determined by external factors like career prospects rather than intrinsic fit and self-concept alignment.

**Insight**: Major satisfaction emerges from congruence between individual needs, interests, abilities, and goals - reflecting successful self-concept implementation in academic choices.

**Technical Approach**: Psychometric scale development and validation study examining relationships between major satisfaction, self-concept congruence, and dropout intentions.

**Evaluation**: Developed validated scale showing major satisfaction predicts retention, academic performance, engagement, and career adaptability.

**Impact**: Supports Present-Moment Decision Making hypothesis - satisfaction with major choice is determined by immediate fit and present experiences rather than projected future outcomes.

## Research Gaps and Future Directions

### Integration Opportunities
- Limited integration between personal intelligence research and peer effects studies
- Need for comprehensive models incorporating both individual psychological factors and social network influences
- Insufficient attention to cultural variations in psychological decision-making processes

### Methodological Advances Needed
- More longitudinal studies tracking psychological factors from pre-enrollment through graduation
- Better integration of experimental interventions with naturalistic decision tracking
- Cross-cultural validation of psychological decision-making models

### Theoretical Development
- Need for unified theory integrating individual differences, emotional factors, and social influences
- Better understanding of how psychological factors interact with information processing and peer effects
- Development of decision-making models that account for both rational and intuitive processes

## Implications for Literature Review

This research provides strong evidence for several of our core hypothesis flips:

1. **Intuitive Decision Primacy**: Matthews et al. (2024) directly shows interest/passion outrank systematic analysis
2. **Individual Agency Challenges**: Multiple studies show decision-making is influenced by psychological states, social support, and interventions
3. **Present-Moment Focus**: Satisfaction research emphasizes immediate fit over future projections
4. **Information Processing Complexity**: Personal intelligence and anxiety research shows individual differences in decision-making capacity

These findings support our literature-level assumption challenges and provide psychological mechanisms underlying the assumption flips we propose.
