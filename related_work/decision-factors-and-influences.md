### Why Students Select their College Major: An Investigative Study
**Authors**: Kate N. Matthews, Diane R. Edmondson, Lucy Matthews (2024)  
**Source**: Academic Management Journal  
**URL**: https://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/amj/vol13/iss1/11/

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: What are the primary factors influencing undergraduate students' college major selection decisions?

**Prior Assumptions**: Rationality Assumption - students systematically weigh external factors like career prospects, salary potential, and market conditions in major selection.

**Insight**: Interest and passion rank as the highest influence factor, followed by fit with personality type. External influences (family pressure, job market conditions) were not as relevant.

**Technical Approach**: Survey data from 1,177 undergraduates at southeastern U.S. university, including major selection influences and demographic items.

**Evaluation**: Ranked factor analysis showing interest/passion as primary driver, consistent for students who changed majors.

**Impact**: Challenges Rationality Assumption - intrinsic factors (passion, personality fit) outweigh systematic economic analysis. Supports Intuitive Decision Primacy hypothesis.

### Major Choices: Students' Personal Intelligence, Considerations When Choosing a Major, and Academic Success  
**Authors**: Kateryna Sylaska, John D. Mayer (2024)  
**Source**: Journal of Intelligence  
**URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11595732/

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: How do students' personal intelligence and consideration factors relate to major choice and subsequent academic success?

**Prior Assumptions**: Individual Agency Assumption - students are primarily autonomous decision-makers exercising independent choice in major selection.

**Insight**: Personal intelligence (ability to understand personality-relevant information) significantly influences major choice considerations and subsequent academic outcomes.

**Technical Approach**: Empirical study measuring personal intelligence, major choice considerations, and academic success metrics among undergraduate students.

**Evaluation**: Statistical analysis of relationships between personal intelligence scores, major choice factors, and academic performance outcomes.

**Impact**: Partially supports Individual Agency but adds nuance - individual differences in self-understanding capacity affect decision-making quality, suggesting some students are more autonomous than others.

### Testing the Effects of an Unobservable Factor: Do Marriage Prospects Affect College Major Choice?
**Authors**: Hayri Alper Arslan, Brantly Callaway, Tong Li (2024)  
**Source**: arXiv:2410.19947  
**URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19947

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: Do marriage prospects influence college major choices, and how can we test effects of unobservable factors in major selection?

**Prior Assumptions**: Individual Agency Assumption - major choices are made independently based on academic and career considerations, not social/relational factors.

**Insight**: Marriage prospects significantly influence college major choices. Unobservable social factors play important roles in academic decision-making.

**Technical Approach**: Developed econometric test using copula-based estimation and leveraging ordered nature of polychotomous choice models. Used National Longitudinal Study of Youth (97) data.

**Evaluation**: Demonstrated significant marriage prospect effects using both the novel testing procedure and validation with stated marriage expectation measures.

**Impact**: Challenges Individual Agency Assumption - major choices are influenced by social relationship considerations beyond academic/career factors. Supports broader social influences in decision-making.

### Factors that Influence a College Student's Choice of an Academic Major and Minor
**Authors**: Paul A. Stock (2019)  
**Source**: Academia.edu Working Paper  
**URL**: https://www.academia.edu/121124790/Factors_that_Influence_a_College_Students_Choice_of_an_Academic_Major_and_Minor

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: What are the top factors influencing undergraduate academic major and minor selection decisions?

**Prior Assumptions**: Linear Decision Process Assumption - students follow predictable stages in major selection and make these decisions at consistent timepoints.

**Insight**: Students identify multiple top factors simultaneously, and timing of major decisions varies significantly across students and changes frequently.

**Technical Approach**: Survey of 386 students in College of Business, asking for top five factors influencing major/minor choice, decision timing, and frequency of changes.

**Evaluation**: Analyzed factor rankings, timing patterns, and demographic correlations with decision characteristics.

**Impact**: Challenges Linear Decision Process Assumption - decision timing varies significantly and factors operate simultaneously rather than in sequential stages. Multiple factors influence decisions concurrently.
