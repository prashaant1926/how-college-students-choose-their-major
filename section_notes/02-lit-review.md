## Summary

The literature on college major choice reveals several systematic patterns that support our hypothesis flips challenging fundamental assumptions about student decision-making. Through systematic review of 15 key papers using Computer Science-inspired research methodology, we identify consistent evidence that contradicts the prevailing assumptions about rationality, individual agency, linear decision processes, information sufficiency, stability preferences, and future orientation in major selection.

The evidence demonstrates that students make major choices primarily through intuitive, experiential processes (challenging Rationality Assumption), within complex social networks rather than individual optimization (challenging Individual Agency Assumption), through non-linear exploration that adds value rather than represents failure (challenging Linear Decision Process and Stability Assumptions), with present-moment factors often outweighing comprehensive information or future projections (challenging Information Sufficiency and Future Orientation Assumptions).

## Key Papers

### Peer Effects and Social Networks

#### Tracking the Herd with a Shotgun — Why Do Peers Influence College Major Selection?
**Authors**: Insler, Rahman, & Smith (2021)  
**Key Findings**: Peers influence major selection primarily through social learning (information sharing) rather than network externalities. Students can be influenced into selecting different academic paths from what they would choose independently.  
**Relevance**: **Challenges Individual Agency Assumption**. Provides causal evidence that major choice emerges from social interactions rather than individual optimization. Supports Collective Agency Dynamics hypothesis.

#### A Model of University Choice with Peer Effects  
**Authors**: Villena, Quinteros, & Poblete-Canepa (2024)  
**Key Findings**: Social dynamics, particularly proportion of high school classmates attending the same university, significantly influence university selection beyond institutional characteristics.  
**Relevance**: **Challenges Individual Agency Assumption**. Demonstrates systematic social influence in educational choice, supporting collective rather than individual decision-making models.

### Major Switching and Non-Linear Exploration

#### Major Decision: The Impact of Major Switching on Academic Outcomes in Community Colleges
**Authors**: Liu, Mishra, & Kopko (2020)  
**Key Findings**: Major switching increases certificate completion rates and can represent better academic matching. One-third of students change majors, with beneficial outcomes for strategic switchers.  
**Relevance**: **Challenges Stability as Success Assumption**. Shows major switching represents sophisticated exploration strategy rather than poor initial decision-making. Supports Non-Linear Exploration Value hypothesis.

#### How Changing Majors Impacts Academic Performance among Undergraduate Students
**Authors**: Xu & de Silva (2024)  
**Key Findings**: About half of undergraduate students change majors at least once, representing normal exploration rather than aberrant behavior. Timing of changes affects graduation timeline.  
**Relevance**: **Challenges Linear Decision Process Assumption**. Demonstrates major choice is iterative process throughout college rather than single decision point.

### Decision Factors and Intuitive Processes

#### Why Students Select their College Major: An Investigative Study
**Authors**: Matthews, Edmondson, & Matthews (2024)  
**Key Findings**: Interest and passion rank as highest influence factors, followed by personality fit. External influences (career prospects, salary) were less relevant than expected.  
**Relevance**: **Challenges Rationality Assumption**. Shows intrinsic factors outweigh systematic cost-benefit analysis. Supports Intuitive Decision Primacy hypothesis.

#### Major Choices: Students' Personal Intelligence, Considerations When Choosing a Major, and Academic Success
**Authors**: Sylaska & Mayer (2024)  
**Key Findings**: Personal intelligence (self-understanding ability) significantly influences major choice quality. Students with higher personal intelligence make more satisfying major choices.  
**Relevance**: **Partially supports Individual Agency** while adding nuance about individual differences in decision-making capacity.

### Information Processing and AI-Augmented Decision Making

#### AI-Augmented Advising
**Authors**: Lekan & Pardos (2025)  
**Key Findings**: AI provides helpful major recommendations (4.0/5 rating from advisors) but only 33% agreement with human advisors. AI excels at information processing but human expertise remains critical.  
**Relevance**: **Partially challenges Information Sufficiency Assumption**. While AI improves information access, agreement rates suggest information alone insufficient for optimal decisions.

#### Choosing Between an LLM versus Search for Learning: A Higher Ed Student Perspective  
**Authors**: Divekar (2024)  
**Key Findings**: Students prefer ChatGPT for academic assistance based on convenience and immediate satisfaction rather than systematic evaluation of learning effectiveness.  
**Relevance**: **Challenges Rationality Assumption**. Tool choice driven by experiential factors rather than deliberate outcome analysis. Supports Present-Moment Decision Making hypothesis.

### Unobservable Social Factors

#### Testing the Effects of an Unobservable Factor: Do Marriage Prospects Affect College Major Choice?
**Authors**: Arslan, Callaway, & Li (2024)  
**Key Findings**: Marriage prospects significantly influence college major choices using novel econometric methodology on NLSY97 data.  
**Relevance**: **Challenges Individual Agency Assumption**. Demonstrates that social relationship considerations influence academic decisions beyond career/academic factors.

#### Superstar Firms and College Major Choice
**Authors**: Choi, Lou, & Mukherjee (2024)  
**Key Findings**: Superstar performer occurrences in industries lead to sharp increases in related major enrollment, but result in lower wages for entry-level employees from these cohorts.  
**Relevance**: **Challenges Rationality and Future Orientation Assumptions**. Students follow visible success stories rather than conducting systematic market analysis or considering long-term wage prospects.

## Research Gaps and Novel Contributions

### Literature-Level Assumptions Identified
The systematic review reveals six pervasive assumptions across the college major choice literature that warrant empirical challenge:

1. **Rationality Assumption**: Systematic cost-benefit analysis drives decisions
2. **Individual Agency Assumption**: Autonomous individual decision-making
3. **Linear Decision Process Assumption**: Predictable exploration → decision → commitment stages  
4. **Information Sufficiency Assumption**: More/better information improves decisions
5. **Stability as Success Assumption**: Staying in initial major represents success
6. **Future Orientation Assumption**: Projected outcomes drive choices

### Research Gaps Our Study Addresses

**Gap 1: Lack of Process-Focused Studies**  
Most literature examines outcomes rather than decision processes. Our research directly observes decision-making in real-time through experience sampling and longitudinal tracking.

**Gap 2: Limited Challenge to Core Assumptions**  
While individual studies question specific aspects, none systematically challenge the fundamental literature-level assumptions we identify. Our assumption-flipping approach provides comprehensive theoretical alternative.

**Gap 3: Insufficient Integration of Present-Moment Factors**  
Literature focuses heavily on future outcomes while underexploring immediate experiential factors. Our research prioritizes present-moment classroom engagement and faculty interaction quality.

**Gap 4: Weak Social Network Analysis**  
Most peer effect studies use limited social network measures. Our approach incorporates comprehensive social network analysis of decision formation.

**Gap 5: Binary Treatment of Major Switching**  
Literature treats switching as success/failure rather than sophisticated exploration strategy. Our research reframes switching as meta-cognitive skill development.

This literature review demonstrates substantial empirical support for our hypothesis flips and identifies critical gaps our research addresses through systematic assumption inversion and comprehensive methodology integration.
