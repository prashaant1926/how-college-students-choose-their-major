## Key Papers

### Tracking the Herd with a Shotgun â€” Why Do Peers Influence College Major Selection?
**Authors**: Michael Insler, Ahmed S. Rahman, Katherine Smith (2021)  
**Source**: IZA Discussion Paper No. 14412  
**URL**: https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/14412/tracking-the-herd-with-a-shotgun-why-do-peers-influence-college-major-selection

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: How and why do peers influence students' college major selection decisions? Understanding the mechanisms behind peer influence in academic choices.

**Prior Assumptions**: Traditional literature assumes that peer influence exists but doesn't distinguish between information-based social learning versus network externalities (socializing motivations).

**Insight**: Peers influence major selection primarily through social learning (information sharing) rather than network externalities (wanting to socialize with similar peers). Students can be influenced to select different academic paths from what they would have chosen independently.

**Technical Approach**: Exploited unique data from US Naval Academy with random assignment of students to peer groups. Used natural experiment design with random reassignments to explore mechanisms.

**Evaluation**: Analyzed preliminary preferences vs ultimate major selections of USNA freshmen, exploiting random peer group assignment and rich covariates.

**Impact**: Challenges Individual Agency Assumption - demonstrates that major choice is significantly influenced by peer information rather than pure individual decision-making. Supports Collective Agency Dynamics hypothesis.

### A Model of University Choice with Peer Effects
**Authors**: Mauricio G. Villena, Maria Quinteros, Daniela Poblete-Canepa (2024)  
**Source**: SSRN Working Paper  
**URL**: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5041739

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: How do social dynamics and peer effects influence university choice decisions, beyond traditional institutional attributes?

**Prior Assumptions**: Traditional university choice models focus on institutional characteristics (rankings, cost, programs) while ignoring social influence factors.

**Insight**: Social dynamics, particularly the proportion of high school classmates attending the same university, significantly influence university selection decisions.

**Technical Approach**: Developed ordered logit model incorporating peer effects, tested using 2022 Chilean National admission process data for Business Administration major.

**Evaluation**: Empirical testing showed significant role of peer effects in university selection decisions using Chilean administrative data.

**Impact**: Demonstrates Collective Agency Dynamics - university choice is partially determined by social connections rather than purely individual optimization of institutional attributes.

### Enhancing Educational Outcome with Machine Learning: Modeling Friendship Formation, Measuring Peer Effect and Optimizing Class Assignment
**Authors**: Lei Bill Wang, Om Prakash Bedant, Zhenbang Jiao, Haoran Wang (2024)  
**Source**: arXiv:2404.02497  
**URL**: https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02497v2

#### Analysis Framework

**Problem**: How can understanding peer effects and friendship formation networks improve educational outcomes through optimal classroom assignments?

**Prior Assumptions**: Traditional linear-in-means models assume uniform connection strength between peers, ignoring network formation complexities and differential peer effects.

**Insight**: Friendship formation can be modeled with interpretable neural networks (PeerNN) that capture network characteristics like gender homophily and varying popularity. Peer effects vary significantly based on network position.

**Technical Approach**: Three-step framework: 1) PeerNN for friendship formation modeling, 2) Linear-in-means model with friendship probabilities for peer effect estimation, 3) Genetic algorithm for optimal class assignment.

**Evaluation**: Used China Educational Panel Survey (CEPS) data, showed PeerNN outperformed traditional models in out-of-sample prediction by significant margins.

**Impact**: Challenges Individual Agency Assumption by demonstrating systematic patterns in social network formation and peer influence. Shows major choices emerge from complex social positioning rather than individual preferences.
