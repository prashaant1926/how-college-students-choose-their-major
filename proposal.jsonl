{"id":"exp-002-social-network","title":"Social Network Influence Manipulation","assumption":"Students are primarily autonomous decision-makers who exercise independent choice in selecting majors","hypothesis":"Students' major choices will be more strongly predicted by peer network characteristics than by individual preference assessments","evaluationPlan":"Experimental manipulation of study group composition with 300 students in groups of 6-8. Conditions: homogeneous major groups, diverse major groups, individual exploration controls. Network analysis of communication patterns and influence flows. Outcome measures: major choice alignment with group members, individual preference stability over time.","implications":"Would shift research focus from individual psychology to social network analysis and cultural capital studies.

{"id":"exp-003-switching-strategy","title":"Major Switching as Exploration Strategy","assumption":"Major choice follows predictable stages with switching indicating suboptimal initial decisions","hypothesis":"Students who engage in structured major exploration with switching options will demonstrate superior meta-cognitive skills and interdisciplinary thinking compared to students committed to single majors","evaluationPlan":"Longitudinal RCT with 450 students across three conditions: encouraged switching, commitment focus, standard advising control. Outcome measures: meta-cognitive awareness assessments, interdisciplinary thinking measures, creative problem-solving tasks, 3-year career satisfaction follow-up.
