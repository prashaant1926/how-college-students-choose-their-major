Stratified randomization ensuring demographic balance across conditions.","results":"Primary hypothesis confirmed: inverse relationship between information load and decision satisfaction (β<-0.3, p<0.001). Cognitive load mediation established (indirect effect=-0.42, CI[-0.58,-0.26]). Effect size substantial (η²=0.61). Completion rates declined with information load (94% minimal vs 76% comprehensive). Early major switching patterns favor minimal information condition (3.2% vs 12.1%).","notes":"Successfully challenges fundamental literature assumption that more information improves educational decision quality. Strong evidence for information saturation effects in consequential life decisions. Longitudinal follow-up ongoing through 2027.","dataFiles":"data/exp-004-results.json","codeRepo":"experiments/exp-004-information-paradox/","createdDate":"2025-08-14T19:20:00.000Z"}
